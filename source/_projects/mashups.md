This is a personal hobby of mine, where I tend to "code surf" <small>(for lack of a better word)</small>, and when I find useful code snippets or interesting small projects, I usually challenge myself by trying to combine all the codes from that surfing session and build something a bit more interesting from them.

## Mashups List

I currently have three mashup projects

- [Traversy Mashups](https://amalkong.github.io/mashups/traversy_media_mashup/) , with codes from &rarr;&nbsp;[Taversy Media](https://github.com/bradtraversy)
- [Web Dev Simplified Mashups](https://amalkong.github.io/mashups/web_dev_simplified_mashup) , with codes from &rarr;&nbsp;[Web Dev Simplified](https://github.com/webdevsimplified)
- [W3 Mashups](https://amalkong.github.io/mashups/w3schools_mashup) , with codes from &rarr;&nbsp;[W3schools](https://w3schools.com)
